# Structure of the repo

* `content/` author files and item files (each item is either a conf, a talk, or a training)
* `generate.py` main generation script
* `templates/` templates directory

  so on), and the `.html` files after generation.

# How to add an author file

* Add the right `.yaml` entry in `content/authors`
* The name of the file is understood as the author nick by the generator
* The file should respect the following schema:

    ```

    email: some@email.com
    picture: mdr.png
    ```

* Please bear in mind that the author picture will be fetched in the
  `web/img/authors/` directory.

* Option : the author can add its formation and a description :

    ```
    name: Complete Name
    email: some@email.com
